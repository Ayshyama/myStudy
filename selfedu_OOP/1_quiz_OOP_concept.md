#### Feat 1. What is the basis of OOP?
Select all correct options from the list

- unification
- migration
- structuredness
- polymorphism     **correct**
- encapsulation    **correct**
- inheritance      **correct**


#### Feat 2. How should a class be perceived in OOP?
Select one option from the list

- as a local storage of heterogeneous data, like a database
- as a template by which objects of this class are constructed                          **correct**
- as a fragment of the program that is executed when this class is called
- the concept of CLASS does not exist in OOP


#### Feat 3. What is the essence of the idea of inheritance in OOP?
Select all correct options from the list

- inheritance allows to take “out of brackets” the common for different classes         **correct**
- based on one or more class objects, new (child) objects are created
- elements of parent classes are randomly shuffled when new (child) classes are formed
- based on one or more classes, a new (child) class is created                          **correct**

#### Feat 4. Is it possible to create programs without using OOP?
Select one option from the list

- yes, for example using structured programming paradigm (not including OOP)            **correct**
- no, OOP is an integral part of large applications
- you can, but then you have to abandon the functional approach to programming
- yes, but only relatively simple

#### Feat 5. You have to write a program for storing information on books: author, title, year of publication, number of pages. Would classes help here to represent this heterogeneous information?
Select one option from the list

- one class in the program is too wasteful
- no, the use of classes in this task will not create additional conveniences and advantages (when programming)
- no, classes should be used not just to store data, but to form some functionality (algorithm) inside them
- yes, describing each book as an object of class "Book" is a good idea                 # correct

#### Feat 6. What term from OOP can characterize the restriction of access to class members?
Select one option from the list

- disguise
- polymorphism
- secrecy
- inheritance
- encapsulation     **correct**

#### Feat 7. You have to create a simple graphic editor program with drawing various graphic primitives (line, rectangle, ellipse, triangle, etc.). Will it make sense to use the concept of OOP in its implementation?

Select one option from the list

- yes, OOP here can significantly simplify the program code    **correct**
- no, a simple graphical editor is more convenient to implement when using structured programming (without OOP)
- no, the program is too simple to have any advantage from OOP

#### Feat 8. Which term from OOP can characterize the universality of the interface for accessing different data types?
Select one option from the list

- inheritance
- polymorphism   **correct**
- standardization
- unification
- encapsulation
